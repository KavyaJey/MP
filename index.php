      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>
        This is a MP mock scheduler. Generating a mock tournament schedule using this schedule maker is very simple. Just follow the steps below: </br>

        1. Enter the first & last names of the players who will be playing in the tournament and make sure to include a comma after each child's last name. </br>
        2. Enter the first & last names of the monitor who have volunteered to be in the mock tournament and make sure to include a comma after each monitor's last name. </br> 
        3. Choose the division that the students are playing in. </br> 
        4. Click the 'Submit' button, and voil√†! Your tournament schedule is ready.

    	About This Site
    </h3>
    <p>
    	I created this website, because I wanted to fix a problem. Scheduling <a href="https://www.mathpentath.org" target="_blank">Math Pentathlon</a> mock tournaments were extremely time-consuming and took a lot of brain-power. I wanted to make it easier. Hopefully this is useful to some of you!

		This website uses round-robin scheduling. A word of thanks goes out to <a href="https://nrich.maths.org/1443" target="_blank"> NRICH's excellent website</a> that helped me understand the algorithms required for this.
